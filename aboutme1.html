    <p class="b">Hi I'm Graham Alban. Following my interests is what lead me to making this website and many other things. Weather it is hanging out with freinds, camping, or playing tennis it is inspired by my interests. I found tennis from where I am from New York. Tennis was huge in New York and followed me to Piedmont, California. Where today I play on our varsity team. With these interests I hope to make it somewhere like UCLA.</p>
